# Bayesian-Methods
Projects made in Python in relation to the course "Bayesian Learning" at LiU. The inference used in these projects utilized a multitude of simulation techniques, such as:
- Direct sampling from conjugate priors
- Direct sampling from the Laplace normal approximation
- Gibbs Sampling
- Random Walk Metropolis / Metropolis Hastings 
- Hamiltonial Monte Carlo (+ NUTS) using PyStan
