# Bayesian-Methods
Projects made in Python in relation to the course "Bayesian Learning" at LiU. The inference utilized a multitude of simulation techniques, such as:
- Direct sampling from conjugate priors
- Direct sampling from the Laplace normal approximation
- Gibbs Sampling
- Random Walk Metropolis 
- Hamiltonial Monte Carlo using PyStan
